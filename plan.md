## Onset Pressure Minimization

For the onset pressure minimization type study, the plan to design a study is:

- Read literature on phonation onset
    - Titze 1988, Lucero 1998, Zhang 2007 (+ additional ones by him)

- Read dynamical systems literature for insights on Hopf bifurcations
    - How do people analyze 'why' Hopf bifurcations occur in dynamical systems?
