## Onset sensitivity

**Motivation**

- Phonation onset pressure is an important metric of speech function as it is one way to characterize the 'ease' with which phonation can be initiated.
- Some studies have shown that phonation onset pressure is elevated in patients with vocal disorders suggesting that vocal disorders could be a cause of the increase.

- Many past studies have investigated phonation onset conditions (pressure, frequency, etc) and the primary factors that influence it.
- [Titze1988], [Lucero1998], [Zhang2007], etc. (see other studies conducted by Zhang's group)

- Earlier studies were gave useful insights but were limited by usage of simplified models
- More recent studies have used continuum models to investigate the onset conditions with linear stability analysis
- These studies have provided useful insights into phonation onset but have been limited by the finite number of parametric variations explored

- To address these limitations, this study aims to investigate phonation onset conditions using sensitivity analysis
- We investigate sensitivity of phonation onset conditions with respect to continuous variations in parameters, specifically, elastic moduli, and shape of the vocal folds

**Misc**
For the onset pressure minimization type study, the plan to design a study is:

- Read literature on phonation onset
    - Titze 1988, Lucero 1998, Zhang 2007 (+ additional ones by him)

- Read dynamical systems literature for insights on Hopf bifurcations
    - How do people analyze 'why' Hopf bifurcations occur in dynamical systems?
